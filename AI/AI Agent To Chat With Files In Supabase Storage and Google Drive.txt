üìù DESCRIPTION
------------------------------
Let AI agents fetch communicate with your Bubble app automatically. It connects direcly with your Bubble data API. This workflow is designed for teams building AI tools or copilots that need seamless access to Bubble backend data via natural language queries.


How it works
Triggered via a webhook from an AI agent using the MCP (Model-Chain Prompt) protocol.
The agent selects the appropriate data tool (e.g., projects, user, bookings) based on user intent.
The workflow queries your Bubble database and returns the result.
Ideal for integrating with ChatGPT, n8n AI-Agents, assistants, or autonomous workflows that need real-time access to app data.


Set up steps
Enable access to your Bubble data or backend APIs (as needed).
Create a Bubble admin token.
Add your Bubble node/s to your n8n workflow.
Add your Bubble admin token.
Configer your Bubble node/s.
Copy the generated webhook URL from the MCP Server Trigger node and register it with your AI tool (e.g., LangChain tool loader).
(Optional) Adjust filters in the ‚ÄúGet an Object Details‚Äù node to match your dataset needs.

Once connected, your AI agents can automatically retrieve context-aware data from your Bubble app, no manual lookups required.
